## user story
    As a user
    I want to be able to search for a musician that I like
    So that I can see a video of one of their songs and see information about that musician.

## About & Features
    Live Link: (https://gavpo.github.io/artist-info/)
    When the search button is clicked then the user is presented with videos of the musician, the artist's discography is displayed, and information about the artist is displayed. 
    This information is gathered using youtube, wikipedia, and theaudiodb's API's. 
    Some initial challenges were how to find the necessary information from each API and how to set the proper parameters for the API. 
    In the future, some other features that could be implemented are a section to display concert or tour dates of the artist, or a page where merchandise of the artist could be purchased.
